# Build Instructions

[Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org) is used for this project's management. Hence, all of our dependencies are
automatically installed when our project is built with Maven. Many modern IDE’s support Maven out-of-the-box. To build
our project in such an IDE, the project folder should be imported as a Maven project to the project’s workspace.

To build the project without using an IDE, Maven command-line tool should be installed to the system. For instructions,
see https://maven.apache.org/install.html. After installing Maven, our project can be built by executing the following
command in our project’s root folder:
`mvn install`

Executing this command will download all the dependencies and generate the jar file required for running this project.
Note that JRE 8 is required to run the jar file. The jar file will be generated in the target folder. Then using the
java -jar command, it can be executed (Note that the version number in the jar’s name can be different):
`java -jar target/patientmonitoring-0.0.1.jar`
